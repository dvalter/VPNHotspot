Connecting things to your VPN made simple. Share your VPN connection over hotspot/system tethering or repeater. (root required)

This app is useful for:

* Connecting things that don't support VPN like Chromecasts behind corporate firewalls;
* Setting up gapps behind corporate firewalls;
* Connecting to your mobile hotspot but you're not bothered to set up VPN on your device;
* Identifying, monitoring and blocking (unwanted) clients;
* Bypassing tethering limits by:
- (recommended) Use this app with a real VPN/socksifier; (ad-blocker may not work)
- (might or might not work based on your carrier) Use this app with TTL editor like
TTL Master;
- Try your luck and simply use this app.
